summary: "When knowledge is abundant, education must focus less on memorization and more on judgment, synthesis, and adaptability."

Education was built for a world where knowledge was scarce.

That constraint is gone.

AI makes information cheap.  
Understanding is now the bottleneck.

---

### Generalists first

In an AI world, breadth compounds faster than depth.

Early specialization made sense when learning was slow.
Now, context switching is cheap and synthesis is valuable.

Specialization should be a **phase**, not a starting point.

---

### Domain crash courses

Instead of long, rigid degrees:
- short, intense learning loops
- goal-driven
- just enough theory to ask good questions

Learn what you need.
Then move on.

### English is the new programming language

Not because code is dead.
But because **intent** matters more than syntax.

Natural language becomes the interface to computation.
Clarity of thought becomes a technical skill.

---

### Learning by use

Education should follow usage, not curriculum.

If you use a concept often:
- the system should notice
- and nudge you to learn it better

A weekly AI recap of what you relied on — not what you memorized.

The goal of education is no longer knowledge.

It’s **capability**.

And AI should dramatically lower the cost of becoming capable.

This is not a list of things AI can never do.

It’s a list of things I don’t want us to **give up responsibility for**.

For my own sanity.

---

### Moral accountability

Decisions that change lives:
- medical choices
- legal judgments
- warfare

AI can advise.
Humans must answer.

---

### Choosing what matters

AI optimizes goals.
Humans choose them.

Deciding *what* to optimize is not a technical problem.
It’s a value judgment.

---

### Trust-bearing roles

Teachers.  
Caregivers.  
Leaders.

These roles are not about correctness.
They are about trust.

---

### Meaning and narrative

AI can generate content endlessly.

But meaning comes from context, intent, and lived experience.
That still feels human.

---

### Knowing when to stop

Optimization has no natural end.

Humans decide:
- when something is good enough
- when less is better
- when to stop

---

AI will replace many tasks.

But some roles are not about efficiency.
They are about responsibility.

For now, that remains human.

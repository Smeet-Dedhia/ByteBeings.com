The most dangerous moment in AI interaction is not training.

It’s the **Send** button.

When we talk to AI today, everything goes through:
- raw
- unfiltered
- unreviewed

Private thoughts, health details, work context, life history — all sent directly to systems we don’t control.

### This is not a privacy issue. It’s an interface failure.

We would never give websites direct access to our computers.
We built browsers, sandboxes, and permission systems.

But with AI, we skipped that layer.

### What’s missing

We need a **consent and context layer** between humans and AI.

A layer that:
- pauses before data is sent
- recognizes sensitive information
- asks for confirmation

Not after the fact.  
Before.

### User-owned context, not vendor memory

Another problem: repetition.

We keep re-explaining who we are, what we do, what we know.

That context should:
- belong to the user
- be reusable
- work across any model

Models should be stateless.  
Humans should own memory.

---

### The principle

AI systems don’t need more access.

Humans need **control**.

We didn’t need better websites.  
We needed browsers.

AI is at that same moment.
